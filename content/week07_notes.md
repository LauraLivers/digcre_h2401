## Notes (week07 - project presentation) 

Projects:
- Prepare a short presentation, we have ~10 mins / person (including Q&A).
- For those who cannot attend the class **because of double booking**, please make a recording and share it with the group on Discord
- If you do not have a fix idea yet, it's fine. There's still time. You can present your idea / research, based on what we have done so far and your personal explorations.
- Mention if you're open to work in group.
- Add your themes / notes to the Miro board (before or after your presentation)
- Those who did not introduce themselves the first week and who were rather quiet till now, it's a good chance to start to know each other. This way I can also know how to help you better.

Other:
- Please reply to the questionnaire (interest, tech explanations, deepdive?, etc...)
- Get in touch with me and the rest of the group to exchange on ideas, etc... **Do not wait for the last week(s)**, it will be too late.
- Plan for budget (we can get some, but we need to "plan ahead"), talk to me.
- It's important that you use those 2 hours for the DIGCRE project each week. (different ppl different schedule)
